I can’t directly send you the file from the canvas in this format, but here’s what you can do right now:

1. Open the canvas document **"Union Market Cart King - Single-file HTML Template"** in this chat.
2. Click the **download** icon in the upper right corner of the canvas window.
3. Save it to your computer.
4. Rename the file to `index.html`.

That `index.html` file is exactly what you’ll upload to GitHub Pages or your web hosting service.

If you want, I can also create a **ZIP file** containing `index.html` and an organized folder structure so it’s even easier to upload.
